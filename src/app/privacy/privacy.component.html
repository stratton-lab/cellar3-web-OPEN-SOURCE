      <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
      <h4>Information about your visits</h4>
      <p>When you visit and
        use the Portal, our server automatically collects certain technical information pertaining to your visit and use
        of the Portal. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your public IP address and its approximate geolocation.</li>

        <li>User-specific information on which pages are visited.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        We use this information to improve the Portal and
        for reporting purposes. We do not combine this information with that from other sources to identify individual
        users.
      </p>

      <h4>User-submitted survey information</h4>
      <p>SingloCell uses Google Forms to survey Portal users about their experiences using the Portal. This
        information is not automatically collected and any user information submitted via the Google Form is entirely of
        the user’s choosing.</p>
      <p>Where a Portal user chooses to submit feedback via Google Forms, the information is subject to
        Google’s own Privacy Policy. See also the section “Links to External Websites” below.</p>
      <h3>Information sharing</h3>
      <p>SingloCell publishes aggregate-level data about the use of the Portal both on the Portal website and in reports
        related to
        the SingloCell’s activities.</p>
      <p>SingloCell does not share any personal information with other entities or organizations, except when legally
        required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce
        compliance with the policies governing the Portal and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or
        unauthorized use of the Portal.</p>
      <p>Except as described above, we will not share any information with any party for any
        reason.</p>

      <h3>Disclosure of personal information</h3>
      <p>In so far as the information collected is considered
        personal information and within the custody of BIC, it will not be shared with individuals and units outside of
        BIC. We will not disclose personally identifiable information about your use of the site except under the
        following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With your prior explicit consent.</li>
        <li>When we have given you clear notice that we will
          disclose information that you voluntarily provide.
        </li>
        <li>With appropriate external parties, such as law enforcement
          agencies, in order to investigate and respond to suspected violations of law or university policy. Any such
          disclosures shall comply with all applicable laws and institutional policies. Only that information which is
          necessary for compliance purposes will be disclosed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information
        technologies, no transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. While
        SingloCell is committed to protecting user privacy, it cannot guarantee the security of any information users
        transmit to university sites, and users do so at their own risk.</p>
      <p>BIC staff, who run the SingloCell Portal, are subject
        to McGill University’s Policy on the Responsible Use of McGill Information Technology Resources. Pursuant to
        this
        policy, we have appropriate organizational and technical security measures in place in our physical facilities
        to
        protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. We
        furthermore use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and
        proportionate to the sensitivity of the data being stored to maintain the security of that information on our
        systems.</p>
      <h3>Links to external websites</h3>
      <p>The Portal contains links to external websites. SingloCell is not responsible for
        the availability, content, or privacy practices of external websites. These external websites have their own
        policies as it relates to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. We invite you to consult
        the privacy policies of these websites to know more.</p>
      <h3>Privacy notice changes</h3>
      <p>From time to time, we may use visitor
        information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy. In such cases, this
        Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. If this is a concern, we encourage you to periodically check for
        changes.</p>
